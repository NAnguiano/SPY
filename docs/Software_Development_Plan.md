#4.0 Software Development Plan

##4.1 Plan Introduction
###4.1.1 Project Deliverables

- _Beta - January 1st - May 6th - After meeting with SPY staff throughout the Fall to demonstrate alpha prototypes, we will continue to gradually release features to them throughout the Spring for testing purposes.
- _2.0 - Late May_ - We transfer ownership of the app over to SPY and take up a maintenance and additional features development role.

##4.3 Project Organization

###4.3.1 Organization Structure

The project demands integration between database, front end, and back end. However, rather than divide the team by section of the app, the app's features have been sectioned horizantally (that is, each team member assigned to implement a feature is responsible for the frontend, backend, and database design of that feature end-to-end). In this manner, each team member gains full-stack development experience, the team can scale effectively while being sensitive to required work and member availability, and base implementations can be delivered for features much more quickly.

###4.3.2 External Interfaces

The team will communicate directly with SPY staff through any means necessary, whether it be email, text, or in-person. Meetings between the team and SPY staff will be documented on notes saved in cloud storage as well as audio recorded so the team has direct resources for user needs.

###4.3.3 Roles and Responsibilities

Each week the development team meets 5:45 PM - 7:00 PM on Thursday evenings. Roles are defined by requirements, features, and components that are being implemented (see Section 5.0 Requirements Specification document). Team members' responsbilities will dynamically change based on which aspects of these features need to be worked on.
